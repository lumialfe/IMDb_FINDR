# IMDB_Demo

## Project Description

This project is a demo of a movie search app. It uses an API to search for movies and display the results. The most
interesting functionality is FINDR, a movie recommendation system based on cards that the user can swipe left or right
on to indicate their preference on the movie shown. This will update the results shown to the user, as well as influence
search results.
